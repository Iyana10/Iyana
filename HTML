         Researchers from the University of Minnesota, with
           <strong>support from Medtronic, have developed a</strong>
            groundbreaking process for multi-material 3D printing of lifelike models of the heart's aortic valve
            and the surrounding structures that mimic the exact look and feel of a real patient.
